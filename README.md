- Hi, Iâ€™m @LeloTibana, I only started my journey in coding in October 2021.
- I am at this point in time skilled in both Front- end and Back-end development. 
- On the Front-end side I skilled in JavaScript - and ES6. With framework/library knowledge in Bootstrap, React, Sass.
- On the Bank-end I have built back-end servers and APIs using Node and Express. 
- Moreover I have dived deep into Python programming and become quite accomplished in it. I can work with Flask, Django, Tkinter/Turtle, web screaping with Beautiful Soup or Selenium WebDriver, PostrgeSQL, MySQL, NumPy, Pandas and many other skills involving Python. 
- I have also earned a certificate in data visualization with Tableau


I am at the stage now where I am entering the job market with no experience but great hunger and desire to help any company or individual who could use my skills. Whether it be on a temporary or permenant basis - I am also willing to relocate to any country if the need should arise.
